The OpenFWI Model Server API provides access to trained Unified Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models
for seismic velocity inversion.

You can use this API to:
- ‚úÖ **Check API health**
- üìù **List available models**
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Get detailed configuration and architecture summaries** for each model
- üöÄ **Perform inference** to generate velocity maps from seismic data

Models are loaded on-demand and cached for efficiency.
